## 1.0 Product Overview
What is the need for improvement in the client organization?

## 2.0 Project Objectives
Specify the objectives of your project in detail, including the business objectives and success metrics.

## 9.0 Reflection on the use of AI
This is the only portion of the deliverable that cannot be written with AI. 

In this section, reflect on how the use of AI impacted your submission of this deliverable. We have included questions here for you to answer as part of your reflection, but we encourage you to go above and beyond if the questions do not address the experience you have had. We urge you to reflect deeply on the use of AI as they contribute towards a significant portion on how your work is evaluated, and this section will largely inform how you work with requirements once you are out in the industry! 

Remember that you must submit your chat logs, thus, we recommend collaborating around one computer in labs or via video chat when you are working on this outside of class time. 

- Specify the model you are using (e.g. ChatGPT 4o) 

- List all the ways that your team used generative AI in this deliverable. Please be specific.  

- What context did you provide to the AI model to derive your desired outputs? How did you decide what context to provide? 

- What aspects of the AI-generated artifact surprised you or that you hadn't considered? Provide examples from your RFP. 

- What are, if any,  some areas where AI did not help you in writing your RFP? Be specific about those areas. If AI was always helpful, why did you experience so much success? (e.g. perhaps your prompting behaviour)

- How confident were you in generative AI’s output? 

- In your observations, what made prompts  effective and what made prompts ineffective? Was it the types of prompt (question-based, instruction-based, etc.)  How did you decide that a prompt was effective, or not? Please give examples of your prompts for both good and bad prompts, and your perceived good and bad responses from the AI model. 

- If you had to repeatedly prompt the AI model, why did you keep updating your prompt? What changes were you making to your prompts? How did you know when you were satisfied with the output? Give examples of conversations requiring repeated or changing prompts. 

- Did you perceive that the AI model gained and maintained contextual understanding during the conversation? E.g. did you keep having to remind the model of something introduced early on? What context did it remember and what context did it forget?



## 10.0 Glossary of terms
Project jargon, or jargon from client organization should be included here so that this document is readable 
by those external to the project.
